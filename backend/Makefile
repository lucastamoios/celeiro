# Scaffold Project Makefile
# =====================
#
# This is the main Makefile for the Scaffold project.
# It contains core targets for development, testing, and infrastructure.
#
# Additional targets are organized in separate files:
# - Makefile.cli: CLI command shortcuts and interactive workflows
#
# Common targets:
#   make up           - Start all services with Docker Compose (detached)
#   make down         - Stop all services
#   make restart      - Restart all services (rebuild with cache - fast)
#   make full-restart - Full restart with no cache (slow but ensures fresh build)
#   make test         - Run tests
#   make cli          - Show available CLI commands

.PHONY: up down restart full-restart setup test

# Check if .env.dev exists, fail with helpful message if not
ifeq (,$(wildcard .env.dev))
    $(error Missing .env.dev file! Create it by copying: cp .envrc .env.dev)
endif

# Load environment variables from .env.dev
include .env.dev
